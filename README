Tea Time 1.0.0

My first WebOS app.

It's a tea timer.

TEA TIMER MANTRA

- Tea Timer must start timing quickly.
- It must match WebOS's style and UI.
- It must allow for multiple steepings.
- It should notify me without requiring interaction afterwards.
- It must record my tea history (coming soon).
- It must allow me track my collection (coming soon).

FORKish

Tea Time is almost a fork of TeaTimer (http://code.google.com/p/webos-teatimer/). After designing Tea Time, I went looking for an app that could do all this. TeaTimer was close. It worked for awhile, but I decided I could do better. Tea Time isn't a fork, as it's coded from scratch, but it's inspired by TeaTimer.
